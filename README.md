Challenge 1: takes an area and finds the larges square that can be created from that area, then repeats that process with the remainder until it reaches 0

Challenge 2: Takes a string that represents a hallway with "<", ">" repressenting people walking the direction of the arrow. The function counts interactions between "people" so ">---<" would produce 2, an interaction for each individual.

Challenge 3: Takes a start int and end int, representing possionts on a chess board with 0 being the top left and 63 being the bottom right. The function counts the number of moves a knight would need to go from start to end in the "L" movement a knight makes.
